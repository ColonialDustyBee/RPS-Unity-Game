# RPS-Unity-Game (Project Created for CS 301 - Data Structures and Algorithms)
This is a short Rock Paper Scissors Unity Game that was worked on as a group over the course of a few months built entirely on C# and the Unity Engine.

If you wish to play it, simply download the Build folder and run the .exe within the folder.

Please keep in mind however, that this is a very early build of the project and as such it isn't as refined as I would like to be. I will most likely go back to it and implement more features when I have free time.
